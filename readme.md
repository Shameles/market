# Steam market chrome extension

> Steam market modification for counter strike global offensive.

Requires at least chrome 40.x 

## Installation

Load it as unpacked extension. (I'm not going to submit it to chrome store)

## What it does

On http://steamcommunity.com/market it will by default show newly listed items, filtered only by cs:go, and only some kinds of weapons (you can modify those weapons in extension options)

On http://steamcommunity.com/market/search you can search multiple items, if you separate them by comma
